# stayingredients-backend

This is the backend for StayInGredients, a recipe app that allows users to specify what ingredients they have available to them and then search for recipes that are possible with those ingredients.

The client-side application is accessible online at 'https://stayingredients-recipe-app.vercel.app'. It can also be downloaded from the Google Play Store as 'StayIngredients Recipe App' or installed as a PWA on mobile and desktop.
